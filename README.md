Chrono Jumper
Chrono Jumper is a simple yet addictive 2D platformer game built using C++ and the SFML library. In this game, you control a character that jumps across moving platforms to achieve the highest score possible. Avoid falling off the screen and time your jumps carefully to land on platforms and keep climbing!
This project is open-source and created as a fun way to demonstrate C++ game development. Your support through GitHub Sponsors helps maintain and improve this project, allowing us to add new features and keep the code accessible to everyone.
Features

Smooth 2D platformer gameplay with responsive controls.
Randomly generated moving platforms for endless replayability.
Score tracking to challenge yourself and others.
Simple audio feedback for jumps.
Lightweight and easy to extend.

Gameplay

Objective: Jump from platform to platform to avoid falling and accumulate points.
